# MyTube
MyTube from Crypticsoft but rebuilt and betterer!

### This template is for those who want to build their own MyTube on their own server, please do not directly copy as that does not make good competition!

### If you just want to visit MyTube then go [here](https://mytube.f87.site/).

# Building
The secret key variable in app.py MUST be changed if you want your users to have safe password hashing.

Running app.py with Python3 and all of the imports installed should run the site on your/your servers IP.

All static files such as images, CSS, JS, etc. must go in the STATIC folder.

HTML files must go in the TEMPLATES folder.

Uploaded videos and video HTML files are auto-assigned a random name to prevent being overwritten, however the chance isn't 0, if you have a better alternative please fork this and submit a pull.

# Contributing
We will accept any contributions and it will grant you a special Contributor badge on MyTube.

# Donations
We will graciously accept donations to fund hosting, however we dont have donations setup yet.
Later on donations will grant a donator badge.
